# EyeNet: Classifying Images For Improved Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy

## Objective
[What is Diabetic Retinopathy?](http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetic-retinopathy/basics/definition/con-20023311)

Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in the working-age population of the developed world. It is estimated to affect over 93 million people.

The need for a comprehensive and automated method of DR screening has long been recognized, and previous efforts have made good progress using image classification, pattern recognition, and machine learning. With photos of eyes as input, the goal of this capstone is to create a new model, ideally resulting in realistic clinical potential.


## Motivations for Project
`"People don't know what they want until you've shown them." - Steve Jobs`

* I've been interested in image classification since the cohort began, and doing it on a large scale. This project is of interest due to how many people are affected, and how many people could seek treatment at an earlier stage.

* Furthermore, the end goal is to work for Apple (you're all tired of hearing it by now). They're rumored to be working on tracking blood glucose with the Apple Watch for diabetics. They're also rumored to be working on glasses; assuming that's true, I'm taking a guess they're working on a feature to track eye health. This project would be something that gets their attention (along with other businesses).
